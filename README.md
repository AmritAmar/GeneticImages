Using Genetic Algorithms to Reproduce Images under Limitations

This is a project I made for my Artificial Intelligence Class under the Team "Real Intelligence". It is a image generation program that uses primitive shapes to generate images using genetic algorithms.

The paper my team wrote for this project is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18TFZThbFswRllVY08Np8gfi7XHtzdqvD/view?usp=sharing

Running this is simple: clone and then adjust parameters in the GeneticImages_SingleParent.java file.
