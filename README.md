# Using Genetic Algorithms to Reproduce Images under Limitations

This is a project I made for my Artificial Intelligence Class under the Team "Real Intelligence". It is a image generation program that uses primitive shapes to generate images using genetic algorithms.

The paper my team wrote for this project is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18TFZThbFswRllVY08Np8gfi7XHtzdqvD/view?usp=sharing

## Examples

Eiffel Tower:

Here I set up the program to recreate the Eiffel Tower. The end result isn't quite as nice as the original, but it does have gradients!

Mona Lisa:

In this case, I set up the program to recreate Mona Lisa. The end result has some detail with the face and the overall picture.

## Getting Started

Simply clone and open this java project. Adjust parameters in the GeneticImages_SingleParent.java file.

Lines 51-52: Adjust the filepath of the image you would like to recreate
Lines 56-62: Comment/Uncomment the shapes that should be included
Lines 64-75: Adjust global Simulation Settings
